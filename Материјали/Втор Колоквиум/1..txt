1.
R - nonClustered 
height 2 and 10 nodes  file has 30 blocks ,each block with 4 records

S - clustered
height 2 and 12 leafs file has 40 blocks, each block with 5 records

What is the number of accesses to blocks

R
1 is for the root,then 2 more to reach the leftmost leaf node, then 9 more to reach the remaining 9 leaf nodes, and to read all leaf nodes 30*4.
1+2+9+120=132

S
1 for the root, 2 more to reach the leftmost node,11 more to reach the remaining leaf nodes and to read all records 40*5 * 3/2
1+2+11+40=54


2.
composite index <deliveries,mileage> that is non-clustered with Alternative 3(key,list of pointers) d=1 height=2
file has 20 blocks

Waht is the num of IO reads to get to the leaf
1 for root, 2 to get the leaf = 3

Num of accesses to blocks(including goint thru the index)
1 for the root,2 to get to the leaf,5 for the possible results =8




4.

100 blocks
nonClustered index on ranking alternative 2 with d=2 with height=3

1 root ,3 to get to index, 100 za sekoj blok

4 to get to the leaf nodes

max-out =2d+1 =5
4 record per block

5^3=125 number of leafes

toa access every record we would need 4*125=500 IO operations
